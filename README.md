# DijkstrasAlgorithmApplicationOnOptimalFlightRoutes
# Program using Dijkstra's Algorithm to determine the quickest path from a departure city to a desired arrival city. 
# Given an N by 4 matrix, where the four columns from left to right are:
# Departure City, Arrival City, Departure Time, Arrival Time.  
# The dataset used has 200 different cities and over 4000 different flights. 
# Choose any of the 200 cities as departure and arrival cities and the program will offer you the most efficient route.
